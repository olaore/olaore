### Hey, I'm Ola

I ship fullstack products that scale.

**5+ years** building production software for startups and agencies across Nigeria, UK, and the US. I've shipped everything from recruitment platforms to hybrid search systems handling hundreds of thousands of product categories.

**What I do:**
- Build products end-to-end: system design → production → scale
- Performance optimization (bundle size, load times, query speed)
- Integrate AI capabilities (semantic search, RAG pipelines, LLM workflows)

**Stack:**  
React/Next.js · TypeScript · Python · Ruby on Rails · Node.js · Docker · AWS

**Recent work:**
- [Gigson.co](https://gigson.co) — Rebuilt frontend, cut bundle size 60%, improved load times 40%
- Hybrid search system for European supply chain — made queries 30x faster with 99% accuracy on misspellings

**Currently:**  
Open to remote fullstack roles and contracts (GMT+1, overlaps with EU business hours)
